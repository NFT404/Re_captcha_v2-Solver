#Re_captcha v2 Solver python

With this script programmed in python and using a web automation framework I demonstrate a quick and very simplified way on how you can solve the captcha v2 with the most common and limited way because after a certain amount of attempts google will restrict the access to the captcha by audio.

In this script I make use of libraries like selenium to solve in a simple way this captcha, also remember to install all the requirements before using the script.
